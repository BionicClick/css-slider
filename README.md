CSS Slider
=====================

This is a mainly CSS based modern image and text slider â€“ hardware accellerated by default. Written by [Anselm Hannemann](https://twitter.com/helloanselm).

Contents
--------

CSS Slider consists of a little set of files with minimal markup. I wanted to keep everything plain and simple:

	index.html contains the markup and references to CSS and JavaScript
	site/css/normalize.css contains normalize.css
	slider.css contains the styles for the slider
	slider.js contains the helpers for the slider
	img/* contains the images that are used in the slider


Instructions
-------

For more instructions have a look at the Code or the [Wiki](https://github.com/anselmh/css-slider/wiki).
